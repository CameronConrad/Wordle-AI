# Wordle-AI
A program to solve Wordle puzzles

## Usage
This program runs in the console and can be used to solve Worldle puzzles. 
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your guess. Type the five letter
word you entered in a Wordle game. Next, you will be prompted to enter the colors you observed 
when you entered your guess in a Wordle game. Enter a five-letter string, with each letter 
representing a specific color:

```
g: green
y: yellow
n: gray
```

Example:
```
Enter your guess: pizza
Enter the color result (g: green, y: yellow, n: gray): ggnnn
```

The program will then return a list of five letter words that fit the criteria for the correct answer. 
Continue to add guesses and guess color until the answer is narrowed down sufficiently!
